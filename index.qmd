:::

## Overview
This workshop covers a basic end-to-end deep learning workflow for EFI applications, covering an introduction into deep learning, to data prepartation, and finally a demo of model training, evaluation, and deployment. There will also be some examples of real world forest inventory deep learning applications showcasing some of the possibilities there are with these techniques.

### You will learn
- What deep learning is and how it can be used for EFIs.
- How to prepare and read in data for use in deep learning.
- Basics of using the <a href="https://pytorch.org/" target="_blank">PyTorch</a> deep learning library.
- Deep learning based forest attribute feature extraction.
- Training a deep learning model for classification tasks.
- Validation and testing of deep learning models.

## Prerequisites
- Comfortable with Python and Jupyter notebooks.
- Google Colab will be used for running the live demo.
