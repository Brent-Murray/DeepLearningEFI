## What is Deep Learning?
Deep learning is a branch of machine learning, and both are forms of artificial intelligence (AI). **AI** refers to methods that enable machines to mimic human behavior. **Machine learning** is a subset of AI that uses statistical techniques to allow machines to improve their performance through experience, while **deep learning** is a subset of machine learning that enables the computation of multi-layered neural networks. A neural network is a term that is used interchangably with deep learning and we will use them both throughout this workshop.

### Components of a Deep Neural Network

There are several key components and terms commonly used to describe a neural network. The **depth** of a neural network refers to the number of **layers** in its architecture (the example in @fig-neuralnetwork has five layers), whereas the **width** refers to the number of neurons within each layer.

The most fundamental unit of a deep neural network is the **neuron**, which serves as the building block of any neural network. A neuron receives a set of inputs ($x_i$), computes their weighted sum ($w_i$), and adds a bias term ($b$). These **weights** and **biases** are adjustable parameters that the network learns during training.

$$
\Large y = w_1x_1 +w_2x_2 + b
$$

Another important part of a neuron is called the **activation**. The output of the weighted sum ($y$) is passed through an activation function, which determines the strength of the output and whether the neuron becomes activated or not.

There are many activation functions, and you are encouraged to resarch which one would be best for your specific use case.

### The Prediction - Feedback Loop
The **prediction-feedback loop** is what makes **learning** possible as a deep learning model doesn't just memorize, it **adapts** and **generalizes**. This allows a model to fine-tune how it *sees* the input data to improve its performace.
